# RandomStudent
Simple webpage with Bootstrap 5 layout where you can upload an Excel file with two columns:
- Student
- Group

With uploading the Excel file one student, belonging to a group, is randomly chosen. This student can show off his/her knowledge on behalf of the group. Randomly picking a student by the teacher is most honest and keeps all students sharp. The scripts doesn't take into account that a student has been chosing previously.
